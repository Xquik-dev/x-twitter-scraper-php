     * @param string|null $to End of the window. Takes the forms of from. Defaults to 7 days after from. Alias untilTime.
     * @param string|null $team Keeps only 1 team's games, by team ID. Each game lists its teamIds. Aliases teamId & team_id.
     * @param string|null $fields Fields to keep in each row, comma-separated. Use dots for nested fields, such as author.username. A list keeps the field in each item. Case & underscores do not matter. A row that lacks a field leaves it out. Cursors, counts & diagnostics always stay. An unknown name answers 400 unknown_field with the valid names, before any read. The price stays the same. SDK row types then hold only the named fields. A longer URL fails at the edge before Xquik reads it. Pick only the fields you need with `fields` & `omit`.
