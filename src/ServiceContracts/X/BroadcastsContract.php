Case & underscores do not matter. A row that lacks a field leaves it out. Cursors, counts & diagnostics always stay. An unknown name answers 400 unknown_field with the valid names, before any read. The price stays the same. SDK row types then hold only the named fields. A longer URL fails at the edge before Xquik reads it. Pick only the fields you need with `fields` & `omit`.
